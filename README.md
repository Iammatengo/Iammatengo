### About Me
Davis Obonyo Matengo is my name, and I'm from Nairobi, Kenya. I'm a self-taught frontend web developer who's working on acquiring the abilities one by one. I've already dabbled in HTML and CSS, and I'm now dabbling in JavaScript. One day, I hope to establish my own start-up company that provides solutions to the world's problems.

Interest
Languages: PHP, JavaScript
Frameworks: Laravel, CodeIgniter, ReactJS, jQuery
CMS: WordPress
Virtualization: Docker
Cloud Computing Platforms: Google Cloud Platform
Workflow: Scrum and Kanban

Random Fact: I enjoy searching the internet for new and interesting things to learn; no knowledge is ever wasted. That's how I ended up at Tech, and now the adventure begins.
